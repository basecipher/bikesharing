# bikesharing

Overview 
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Purpose
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

Technical details
The programming language used was Python 3.7.7 64-bit. The following packages were used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, plotly & datetime
